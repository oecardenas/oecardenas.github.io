<p1>"Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. When you pour water in a cup,
it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can flow or it can crash.
Be water my friend." - Bruce lee</p>

<p>Bruce lee born in November 27, 1940 and his death in July 20, 1973 in Tong. A younger fighter and actor. He feared almost no one, he doesn't fear the man that learns 10,000 kicks but the man the that pratice 1 kick 10,000 times. Sharp and quick, it was rumored that he moved so fast for camera he was told to slow done so what he did could be captured. Like father like son they both died at a pretty yougn age. His son died while recording a movie. The gun that need blanks, had 1 really bullet that killed him. In the end he died but he finish the move strong like his father. </p>
